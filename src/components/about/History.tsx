            The Coromandel coast was known for its ports from the early common
            era. The English found the Cooum outlet to be a place for trading
            post during 1639 and thus the Madras Port was set up. Madras being
            home to three rivers, i.e., the Kosathalayar, Cooum, and the Adyar,
            was home to one of the first rowing and sailing centres started by
            the British. In 1867, quite a few of the Britishers in Madras took
            to the sport in full vigour and their congregation was christened
            the Madras Boat Club ( MBC ). The first formal boating ( sailing and
            rowing ) activities of MBC took place on the Ennore Creek, which is
            fed by the Kosathalayar river. The boating activity slowly shifted
            to the Adyar River flowing straight through South Chennai. By the
            early part of the 20th century, MBC was holding regattas. In 1911,
            the first Chairman of Madras Port established Madras Sailing Club (
            MSC ) inside the Madras Port. The sailing boats of the MBC were
            handed over to MSC. In 1926, the Club through a royal charter from
            King George V, was given the honorific &apos;Royal&apos; and was
            renamed the Royal Madras Yacht Club ( RMYC ), thus honouring not
            just the Club but also the city of Madras. The Club was relocated to
            the present place, east of the Boat Basin and the foundation stone
            of the present Clubhouse was laid by Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw in
            1981. The Clubhouse was inaugurated by the Chief of Naval Staff
            Admiral Tahliani in 1987.

            Under the patronage of the Chairman of the Chennai Port Authority,
            the Club is run by an elected committee of sailing members who are
            Indians and professionals in various walks of life. The Club is
            registered under the Registrar of Societies and is non-profit in
            nature. The Committee raises money through events and sponsors.
